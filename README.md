HI! The bot and plugin are both still very much in a beta stage. They are unfinished, and you may experience instabilities.
Additionally, there exist fields for the config that are not yet serialized (thus, when reading the config docs, you may find information that isn't yet exposed).

## Setup
Extract zip and place all the resulting `.dll` files into your `ServerPlugins` folder. If I've forgotten to include the binaries in the zip, navigate to `./References/` and download them from there.

Run the tShock server once to allow the plugin to automatically generate the applicable config files. To learn more about those, find and read [UserDocs/Config/README.md].\
Set up as appropriate (set Discord bot, set un/verified group names).

Then you should be good to go! Happy Terraria-ing.
